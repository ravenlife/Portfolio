Portfolio
=========

Portfolio is a WIP multi-user portfolio extension for Joomla! 2.5 built on Nooku Framework 12.1, licensed GNU/GPL V3.

Please note that support will only be given for this extension if/when I have the time, which will not be often, so I recommend you only use this extension on production sites if you know what you are doing.
